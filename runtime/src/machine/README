I should have put each architecture under a different directory, but 
I don't have plans to implement the machine dependent module on other
platforms other than Pentium 6+.

I cannot control the code generation for cas64 and casd, so I decided to
move them out from atomic.c into cas64.s. Essentially the code generated
by the compiler stores the lower order bits to ecx and higher order bits
to ebx, which is exactly the reverse as what I want.
