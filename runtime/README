Modify Makefile.common for the optimization options or directory settings.

Build is a file used to record the last build time. 

I have made a static library and a dynamic library for the same tmpi
library.  To make dynamic library work, we need to set two environment
variables to the directory where the dynamic library can be found:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH (the first is used during the execution
and the second is used during the compilation so that you don't have to
specify -L...)

You might also need to update ~/.ssh/environment and put the values of
these two variables in the form of VARIABLE=VALUE in which VALUE cannot
have any $Var variables in it. (not very portable)

To link with static library, use -static option and you need to add
-lpthread if the underlying ukey and thread module is based on pthread.

To compile sources that is supposed to be linked with TMPI library,
add -I<tmpi_include> option when compiling the source code.
