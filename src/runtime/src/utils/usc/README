USC is a very fine grain clock utility.
usc_time_t holds a reference of the clock counter (64 bits).
usc_difftime(t1, t2) reports the time difference in the unit of microseconds.
you need to call usc_init() before you call usc_difftime().
usc_mhzrate() returns the cpu speed of the machine the process runs on.

See test/usctest.c for details.
